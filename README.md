Subsurface is a web application built upon the Grails framework that provides the user with three interactive stages with regards to concerts happening in Dublin. 

The stages I have dubbed as ‘Pre’ – where the concert is in the future; ‘Mid’ – when the concert is actually happening; and ‘Post’ whereby the concert has occurred, relative to the current date. There are various functions available at each stage.
